Compound Kit empowers developers to rapidly build intent-centric applications and enhances the user experience for the Compound protocol. This repository includes the Compound Kit SDK which helps developers use the [Compound Kit API](https://github.com/dinngo/compound-kit-api/tree/master) without directly dealing with API requests and responses.

You can find more details at [Compound Kit Overview](https://docs.protocolink.com/compound-kit/overview).
